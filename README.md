Open source command line for Indirecta Xinu HSE
Note: This is an execution file/program/application for the Indirecta Xinu HSE platform. This program is free open source software, while the Xinu HSE Platform is a licensed, obfuscated, paid software that costs 60R$, if you are contributing to this project, you can either buy the license and develop directly on Xinu, or make changes that will be tested by me (Lxi099 or FireAlarmManBeta)
